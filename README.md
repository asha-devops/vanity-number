# vanity number generator serverless function

## Vanity Number
A vanity number is a custom made set of digits that either spell out a word or memorable in same way, where are spelled out using the numbers on the telephone keypad

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless vanity number generator application that you can deploy with in few minutes using SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- vanity_number - Python source code for serverless Lambda function that generates best memorable vanity numbers based on the contact number pass as an event. Sample payload is described . 
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function locally, filename `events/data.json`.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.
- local-db-create.json - Table definition to create database locally(powered by aws dynamodb local. More instructions on how is mentioned below).
- aws-connect-export.json - Export file of aws connect work flows just for reference.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda function and a dynamoDB. Vanity numbers are generated by library `vanity_number/wordify.py`. This library use static dictionary file maintained as `vanity_number/dictionary.txt` to generate best memorable vanity numbers. This application stores the contact number, vanity numbers for the contact numbers and timing information when the vanity numbers were first generated. AWS resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. The template can be updated to accomodate new AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates the application code.

## Deploy the serverless vanity number generator application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build --use-container
sam deploy --guided
```

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

* **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching your project name.
* **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to.
* **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
* **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modifies IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
* **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

You can find Lambda arn printed as output that can be used to integrate AWS connect work flow.

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build --use-container` command.

```bash
$ sam build --use-container
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `vanity_number/requirements.txt`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command. To Test dynamodb locally, Follow the instruction to start dynamodb locally[DynamoDb Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html). Create table locally using the table definition `local-db-create.json` file. Execute below command to create table locally and set environment variable `AWS_SAM_LOCAL` to `true`

```bash
aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file://local-db-create.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

```bash
$ sam local invoke LambdaFunction --event events/event.json
```

## Add a resource to your application
The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Integrating lambda with AWS Connect 

AWS Connect instance and flows for this project are created manually using aws console. Exported contact flow in stored as `aws-connect-export.json` in this repository.

Below flows are currently enabled for this project
* Incomming facility with a connect flow integration
* Triggers serverless application function deployed as part of this repository.
* Playbacks the vanity numbers generated by the lambda based on the contact number from which you are calling from. Data is backed with dynamodb.
* Sample inbound transfer is integrated for demo purpose

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
$ sam logs -n LambdaFunction --stack-name vanity-number --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name vanity-number
```

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
